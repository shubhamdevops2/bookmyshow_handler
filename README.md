# Handler server

This server functions as a middleware between the front-end and backend applications, facilitating the communication and passing API requests between the two. It acts as an intermediary, enabling seamless interaction and data exchange between the front-end and backend components of the application.

# Architecture


## Index.js

- This server is based on the express.js app so it uses 3001 port to access the server side API's. 
- The server will only look for the index.js file so we can ignore all other configuration files
- Please review the Index.js file for detailed comments and explanations to understand the code better


## Dockerfile

- Please refer to the Dockerfile for comments and explanations to gain a deeper understanding.
